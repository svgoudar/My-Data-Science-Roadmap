    "* The goal is to find the **optimal number of clusters**.\n",
    "* We use **WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares)** = sum of squared distances between each point and its cluster centroid.\n",

    "### ðŸ”¹ Elbow Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run K-Means for different values of $k$ (e.g., 1 to 20).\n",
    "2. For each $k$, compute WCSS.\n",
    "3. Plot **WCSS vs. k**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * When $k = 1$, WCSS is high (all points assigned to one cluster).\n",
    "   * As $k$ increases, WCSS decreases because more centroids reduce distances.\n",
    "4. At some point, the decrease slows down and the curve looks like an **elbow**.\n",
    "5. The **elbow point** = optimal $k$.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Use **Elbow Method** to pick $k$.\n",
    "* WCSS decreases with higher $k$, but after some point the benefit is negligible.\n",
