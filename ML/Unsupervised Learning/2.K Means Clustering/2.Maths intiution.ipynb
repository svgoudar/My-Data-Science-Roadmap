    "# ðŸ”¹ Mathematical Intuition of K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of **K-Means** is to partition $n$ data points into $k$ clusters such that the **within-cluster variance** is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Objective Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a **loss function (cost function)** that K-Means tries to minimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{x \\in C_i} ||x - \\mu_i||^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $k$ = number of clusters\n",
    "* $C_i$ = cluster $i$ (the set of points belonging to cluster $i$)\n",
    "* $\\mu_i$ = centroid (mean) of cluster $i$\n",
    "* $||x - \\mu_i||^2$ = squared Euclidean distance between point $x$ and its centroid\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ This means: **put points close to their centroid to reduce the total squared error.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Two Optimization Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means alternates between two sub-problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "### (A) **Assignment Step (Fix centroids, assign points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each point $x_j$, assign it to the closest centroid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_j = \\arg\\min_{i} \\; ||x_j - \\mu_i||^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here $c_j$ is the cluster assignment for point $x_j$.\n",
    "* Intuition: pick the cluster whose centroid is nearest to the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### (B) **Update Step (Fix assignments, update centroids)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each cluster, recompute its centroid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_i = \\frac{1}{|C_i|} \\sum_{x \\in C_i} x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is just the **mean** of all points in cluster $i$.\n",
    "* Why the mean? â†’ Because the **mean minimizes squared distances** (thatâ€™s the key mathematical fact).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Why the Mean is the Best Centroid?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s prove:\n",
    "Given a cluster $C$, we want to find the point $\\mu$ that minimizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(\\mu) = \\sum_{x \\in C} ||x - \\mu||^2\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mu} = \\sum_{x \\in C} 2(\\mu - x) = 2|C|\\mu - 2\\sum_{x \\in C} x\n",

    "\n",
    "Set derivative = 0:\n",
    "\n",

    "\\mu = \\frac{1}{|C|} \\sum_{x \\in C} x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ So the **mean** is the optimal centroid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Iterative Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step (A) ensures each point is assigned to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "* Step (B) ensures centroids move to the optimal mean location.\n",
    "* Each iteration **decreases (or keeps constant)** the cost function $J$.\n",
    "* Since $J$ is bounded below (â‰¥0), the algorithm **converges** (though it may reach a local minimum, not global).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Geometric Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The algorithm partitions the space into **Voronoi regions** â†’ each centroid \"owns\" the area closer to it than any other centroid.\n",
    "* Final clusters are like **convex polygons** in Euclidean space.\n",

    "âœ… **Summary**:\n",

    "* K-Means minimizes **sum of squared distances** between points and their cluster centers.\n",
    "* Assignment = nearest centroid.\n",
    "* Update = centroid = mean of cluster.\n",
    "* Repeats until convergence â†’ stable clusters.\n",
