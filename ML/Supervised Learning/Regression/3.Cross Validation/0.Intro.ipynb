    "# üîÑ Types of Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Hold-Out Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Process**: Split dataset into **train set** and **test/validation set** (e.g., 70% train, 30% test).\n",
    "* **Use**: Simple, but performance depends heavily on the random split.\n",
    "* **Limitation**: High variance ‚Üí results may change if split changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. k-Fold Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Split dataset into *k* equal parts (folds).\n",
    "  2. Train model on *(k-1)* folds.\n",
    "  3. Validate on the remaining fold.\n",
    "  4. Repeat until each fold is used once as validation.\n",
    "  5. Average results.\n",
    "* **Common choice**: `k = 5` or `k = 10`.\n",
    "* **Benefit**: Reduces variance compared to hold-out.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Stratified k-Fold Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Special case of k-Fold** for **classification problems**.\n",
    "* Ensures **class proportions** (e.g., number of positives/negatives) are the same in each fold as in the original dataset.\n",
    "* Prevents bias when classes are imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Each observation becomes its own test set.\n",
    "  * Train on `n-1` samples, test on 1 sample. Repeat `n` times.\n",
    "* **Use**: Maximum training data used each time.\n",
    "* **Limitation**: Very expensive when dataset is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Leave-P-Out Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similar to LOOCV, but instead of leaving out **1 point**, we leave out **p points** at a time.\n",
    "* **Limitation**: Computationally expensive (number of combinations explodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Time-Series Cross-Validation (Forward Chaining / Rolling CV)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **time-series data** where order matters.\n",
    "* **Process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Split data chronologically.\n",
    "  * Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Train on \\[1‚Ä¶t], test on \\[t+1].\n",
    "    * Train on \\[1‚Ä¶t+1], test on \\[t+2], etc.\n",
    "* **Use**: Ensures no ‚Äúfuture data leakage‚Äù into training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Repeated k-Fold Cross-Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Process**: Repeat k-Fold CV multiple times with **different random splits**.\n",
    "* **Benefit**: Gives a more reliable estimate by reducing variance.\n",
    "* **Use**: Helpful for small datasets.\n",
