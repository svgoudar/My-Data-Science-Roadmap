    "## 🔹 1. Manual Search\n",
    "\n",
    "* You try hyperparameters based on **intuition/experience**.\n",
    "* Example: Set `alpha = 0.1` in Ridge Regression, check performance, then try `alpha = 1`.\n",
    "  ✅ Simple, fast.\n",
    "  ❌ Not scalable, may miss optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2. Grid Search Cross Validation (GridSearchCV)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exhaustively tries **all combinations** of hyperparameters.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "param_grid = {\"alpha\": [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It will train the model with **each value** and pick the best based on CV score.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Finds best within defined grid.\n",
    "❌ Very slow if parameter space is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 3. Random Search Cross Validation (RandomizedSearchCV)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Randomly selects combinations of hyperparameters from a given distribution.\n",
    "* Not every combination is tested, but sampling is efficient.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "param_dist = {\"alpha\": np.logspace(-3, 2, 100)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Faster than Grid Search, good for large search spaces.\n",
    "❌ May not find the exact global best, but usually close enough.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔹 4. Bayesian Optimization (e.g., Optuna, Hyperopt, skopt)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses **probabilistic models** (Gaussian Processes, TPE) to choose the next set of hyperparameters based on **past results**.\n",
    "* Focuses on promising regions instead of blind search.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Much faster than Grid/Random Search.\n",
    "✅ Works well in large & continuous parameter spaces.\n",
    "❌ More complex to set up.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 5. Gradient-based Optimization (e.g., Hypergradient Descent)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adjusts hyperparameters (like learning rate, regularization strength) using gradients of the validation error.\n",
    "* Mostly used in neural networks, not very common in basic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 6. Evolutionary Algorithms / Genetic Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mimics **natural selection**: starts with random hyperparameters, mutates, and evolves over generations.\n",
    "* Used when search space is very complex (e.g., many hyperparameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Can handle discrete + continuous hyperparameters.\n",
    "❌ Slower than Bayesian Optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🔹 7. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tools like **Auto-sklearn, TPOT, H2O, Google AutoML** combine different tuning methods.\n",
    "* They search across hyperparameters and model types.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Best for non-experts.\n",
    "❌ Less control, can be resource-heavy.\n",
