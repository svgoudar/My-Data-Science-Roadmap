    "## **1. What is Lasso Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso** stands for **Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator**.\n",
    "It’s a **linear regression** technique that uses **L1 regularization** to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduce overfitting.\n",
    "* Perform **feature selection** by shrinking some coefficients to exactly **zero**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. The L1 Regularization Formula**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **ordinary least squares (OLS)**, we minimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Loss} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Lasso**, we add a penalty term:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Loss} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\lambda$ = regularization parameter (controls penalty strength).\n",
    "* $|\\beta_j|$ = absolute value of coefficient.\n",
    "* Intercept ($\\beta_0$) is usually not penalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Effect of L1 Penalty**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If λ = 0** → Same as OLS (no regularization).\n",
    "* **If λ is small** → Slight shrinkage, coefficients reduced but most remain non-zero.\n",
    "* **If λ is large** → Many coefficients shrink to **exactly zero** (feature elimination).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Why Lasso Can Zero Out Coefficients**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the **absolute value function** creates sharp corners in the cost function's geometry (diamond-shaped constraint), so the optimization often hits exactly zero for some coefficients.\n",
    "This is **different from Ridge (L2)**, which only shrinks coefficients but never makes them exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. When to Use Lasso**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ When you suspect **many irrelevant features**.\n",
    "✅ When you want **automatic feature selection**.\n",
    "✅ When you have **high-dimensional data** (p >> n).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Visual Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Think of it as forcing coefficients to live inside a **diamond-shaped boundary**.\n",
    "* Because of the diamond’s corners, optimization naturally “sticks” some coefficients at zero.\n",
