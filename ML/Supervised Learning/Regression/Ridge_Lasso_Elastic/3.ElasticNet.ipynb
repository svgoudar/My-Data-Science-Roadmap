    "\n",
    "**Elastic Net Regression** is a **regularized linear regression** technique that combines the penalties of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lasso (L1)** ‚Üí drives some coefficients to **zero** (feature selection).\n",
    "* **Ridge (L2)** ‚Üí shrinks coefficients (handles multicollinearity).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is especially useful when you have **many correlated features**.\n",
