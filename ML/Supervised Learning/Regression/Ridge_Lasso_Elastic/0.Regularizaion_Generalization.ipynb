    "Regularization is a **technique to prevent overfitting** by adding a penalty to the modelâ€™s complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In ML, models (like Linear Regression, Neural Networks) may learn **too much noise** from training data â†’ they fit training data perfectly but fail on unseen data.\n",
    "* Regularization reduces this by penalizing **large weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "* **L1 (Lasso)** â†’ penalty = sum of absolute values of weights â†’ forces some weights to **zero** (feature selection).\n",
    "* **L2 (Ridge)** â†’ penalty = sum of squares of weights â†’ shrinks coefficients but keeps all features.\n",
    "* **Elastic Net** â†’ mix of L1 and L2.\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\lambda$ = regularization strength\n",
    "* $R(\\beta)$ = penalty term (L1/L2/ElasticNet)\n",

    "\n",
    "Generalization is a modelâ€™s **ability to perform well on unseen data**, not just the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A model that **memorizes training data** (overfits) has **low generalization**.\n",
    "* A model that is **too simple** (underfits) also fails to generalize.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship with Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regularization improves **generalization** by preventing the model from becoming too complex.\n",
    "* By shrinking weights, the model focuses on **important patterns**, not noise.\n",

    "* **Overfitting (high variance)**: model too complex â†’ high training accuracy, poor test accuracy.\n",
    "* **Good Generalization**: balance of bias & variance â†’ good test accuracy.\n",
