    "# 🌟 Ensemble Techniques in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble techniques involve **combining multiple individual models** to create a stronger, more accurate predictor.\n",
    "This is very common in practice and especially in **competitive ML platforms like Kaggle**, where winners often rely on ensembles to squeeze out the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A group of weak or diverse models, when combined, can outperform a single strong model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 Why Use Ensembling?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduces **variance** (overfitting).\n",
    "* Reduces **bias** (underfitting).\n",
    "* Improves **generalization** to unseen data.\n",
    "* Makes predictions more **robust**.\n"

    "## 🔹 Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging trains multiple models in **parallel** on different random subsets of the training data (sampled *with replacement*).\n",
    "The predictions are then combined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Majority voting** → classification\n",
    "* **Averaging** → regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take the training dataset.\n",
    "2. Randomly create bootstrap samples (with replacement).\n",
    "3. Train one base learner per bootstrap sample.\n",
    "4. Aggregate predictions (vote or average).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parallel training**: All models are trained independently.\n",
    "* **Variance reduction**: Reduces overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting trains models **sequentially**. Each new model focuses on the errors made by the previous models, gradually improving the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train the first weak learner (e.g., shallow decision tree).\n",
    "2. Increase the importance (weights) of misclassified points.\n",
    "3. Train the next model on the updated dataset.\n",
    "4. Repeat until a strong ensemble is built.\n",
    "5. Final prediction: weighted voting (classification) or weighted average (regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sequential training**: Each model depends on the previous.\n",
    "* **Bias reduction**: Focused on improving weak spots.\n",
    "* **Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **AdaBoost**: Adjusts weights of misclassified points.\n",
    "  * **Gradient Boosting**: Optimizes a loss function directly.\n",
    "  * **XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost**: Modern scalable boosting algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacking combines **different models** (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree) and uses another model (meta-learner) to learn how to best combine their outputs.\n",
