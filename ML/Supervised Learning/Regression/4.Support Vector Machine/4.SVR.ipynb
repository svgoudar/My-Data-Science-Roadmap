    "### Script Summary: Support Vector Regression (SVR) in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Welcome back! In this video, weâ€™ll discuss **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**.\n",
    "- Previously, we covered **Support Vector Classification (SVC)**, its cost function, constraints, and the hinge loss.\n",
    "- Weâ€™ll now focus on how SVR handles **regression problems** and adapts concepts like cost functions and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Regression Problem Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression predicts a **continuous target variable**.\n",
    "- Example: Predicting the **price of a house** based on its **size**.\n",
    "- Unlike classification, SVR aims to:\n",
    "  - Find a **best-fit line**.\n",
    "  - Create **marginal planes** around this line.\n",
    "  - Ensure most data points fall within the margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Concepts in SVR**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Function**:\n",
    "   - SVR minimizes $\\frac{1}{2} ||w||^2$ while introducing **constraints**.\n",
    "   - Constraints ensure the model generalizes well and minimizes the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Best-Fit Line and Margins**:\n",
    "   - The line is represented as $w^T x + b$.\n",
    "   - Marginal planes are defined as:\n",
    "     -$w^T x + b + \\epsilon$(upper margin).\n",
    "     -$w^T x + b - \\epsilon$(lower margin).\n",
    "   - **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$)**: Represents the **margin of tolerance** for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Constraints**:\n",
    "   - The absolute difference between the true value ($y_i$) and the predicted value ($w^T x + b$) should be:\n",
    "    $\n",
    "     |y_i - (w^T x + b)| \\leq \\epsilon\n",
    "    $\n",
    "   - This ensures most points fall within the marginal planes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some points may fall **outside the margin**.\n",
    "- To account for these, we introduce:\n",
    "  - **Slack variables ($\\eta_i$)**: Measure deviation from the margin.\n",
    "  - Updated constraints:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "    |y_i - (w^T x + b)| \\leq \\epsilon + \\eta_i\n",
    "   $\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Modified Cost Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The updated cost function incorporates both$\\epsilon$and$\\eta_i$:\n",
    " $\n",
    "  \\text{Minimize: } \\frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^n \\eta_i\n",
    " $\n",
    "  -$C$: A **hyperparameter** that controls the trade-off between minimizing slack variables and maintaining a flat margin.\n",
    "  -$\\eta_i$: Penalizes points outside the margin, ensuring they are accounted for in optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hyperparameters in SVR**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$)**:\n",
    "   - Controls the marginâ€™s width.\n",
    "   - Larger$\\epsilon$: Allows more tolerance for errors within the margin.\n",
    "   - Smaller$\\epsilon$: Tighter fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **C (Regularization Parameter)**:\n",
    "   - Balances the trade-off between **minimizing margin width** and **tolerating errors**.\n",
    "   - Higher $C$: Less tolerance for points outside the margin.\n",
    "   - Lower $C$: More tolerance for deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationship between$C$and loss:\n",
    "  - As$C$increases, the loss decreases.\n",
    "  - Loss function plot:$C$on the x-axis, loss on the y-axis (assignment to explore).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "- SVR introduces parameters like$\\epsilon$and$\\eta_i$to handle regression effectively.\n",
    "- It ensures a balance between:\n",
    "  - **Minimizing errors within the margin.**\n",
    "  - **Handling outliers outside the margin.**\n",
    "- Practical examples and implementation will be covered in the next video.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Call to Action**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have any questions, drop them in the comments below.\n",
    "- Donâ€™t forget to revise, practice, and keep learning.\n",
    "- See you in the next video. Stay awesome! ðŸš€"
