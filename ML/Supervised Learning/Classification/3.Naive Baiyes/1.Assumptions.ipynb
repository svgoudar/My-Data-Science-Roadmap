    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** All features are **conditionally independent** given the class label.\n",
    "* **Implication:** The presence or value of one feature does not affect another feature within the same class.\n",
    "* **Reality Check:** Rarely true in real-world data, but the model often works well despite this \"naive\" assumption.\n",

    "### 2. **Feature Relevance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** Every feature contributes **equally and independently** to the outcome.\n",
    "* **Implication:** No feature is more important than another unless weighted externally.\n",

    "### 3. **Correctly Specified Likelihood**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** The **distribution of features given the class** is correctly modeled:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** continuous features follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "  * **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** features are counts (e.g., word frequencies).\n",
    "  * **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:** features are binary (0/1).\n",

    "### 4. **Class Prior Probabilities**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** Prior probabilities $P(Y)$ are either known or can be **estimated from the training data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **No Zero Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assumption:** If a feature value never occurs with a class in training, it does **not lead to zero probability** during prediction.\n",
    "* **Solution:** Use **Laplace smoothing** (adding a small value to all counts).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **In short:** Naive Bayes assumes **conditional independence of features**, appropriate feature distribution, and non-zero probabilities for smooth predictions.\n",
