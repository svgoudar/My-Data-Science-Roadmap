    "### **1. Dependent Variable is Binary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression is used for **binary outcomes** (0/1, Yes/No, True/False).\n",
    "* Extensions like **multinomial or ordinal logistic regression** exist for more than two categories.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **2. Linearity of Logit**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assumes a **linear relationship between independent variables and the log-odds** of the dependent variable.\n",
    "* Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{logit}(p) = \\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_n x_n\n",

    "* Note: **Independent variables donâ€™t need to be linearly related to the output probability**, only to the logit.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **3. Independence of Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observations should be **independent of each other**.\n",
    "* No repeated measures or correlated data unless you use techniques like **generalized estimating equations (GEE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. No Perfect Multicollinearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Independent variables should **not be perfectly correlated**.\n",
    "* High correlation can make estimates unstable or inflate standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Large Sample Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic regression uses **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)**.\n",
    "* Requires a reasonably **large dataset** to provide stable and reliable estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Minimal or No Outliers in Predictors**\n",
    "\n",
    "* While logistic regression is **less sensitive to outliers than linear regression**, extreme values can still distort the model.\n",
    "* Consider scaling or removing influential points.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Optional Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Additive effects:** Assumes that the predictors combine additively in the logit scale.\n",
    "* **No assumption of homoscedasticity**: Unlike linear regression, constant variance is not required.\n"
