    "### ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression in Binary Classification\n",

    "* Goal: find a best-fit line to separate two classes.\n",
    "* Problem: What if there are **more than two output categories** (multi-class)?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ Multi-Class Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: 3 categories (Class A, B, C).\n",
    "* Logistic regression can be extended using the **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** strategy.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ One-vs-Rest (OvR) Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Idea**: Train multiple binary classifiers, one for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For class 1 vs (class 2 + class 3).\n",
    "   * For class 2 vs (class 1 + class 3).\n",
    "   * For class 3 vs (class 1 + class 2).\n",
    "2. Each model outputs a probability that a new sample belongs to its target class.\n",
    "3. The **final prediction** = class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",

    "### ðŸ”¹ Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input features: f1, f2, f3.\n",
    "* Output labels (1, 2, 3) â†’ converted into **one-hot encoding**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Class 1 â†’ \\[1,0,0]\n",
    "  * Class 2 â†’ \\[0,1,0]\n",
    "  * Class 3 â†’ \\[0,0,1]\n",
    "* Train 3 models (M1, M2, M3).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * M1 trained with output = Class 1.\n",
    "  * M2 trained with output = Class 2.\n",
    "  * M3 trained with output = Class 3.\n",

    "### ðŸ”¹ Prediction Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "* New test sample is passed through all models:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * M1 â†’ Probability = 0.25\n",
    "  * M2 â†’ Probability = 0.20\n",
    "  * M3 â†’ Probability = 0.55\n",
    "* Since M3 has the highest probability (0.55), the final class = **Category 3**.\n",

    "\n",
    "âœ… **Key takeaway**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic Regression handles multi-class classification using **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** or **One-vs-One (OvO)** strategies.\n",
    "* The prediction is made by comparing probabilities from each model and choosing the class with the highest score.\n",
