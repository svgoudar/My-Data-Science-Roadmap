    "# ðŸ”¹ Workflow of Support Vector Classifier (SVC)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Problem Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define the classification problem (binary or multi-class).\n",
    "* Example: Spam vs Not Spam, Fraudulent vs Genuine Transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Data Collection**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gather labeled data (features $X$ and class labels $y$).\n",
    "* Ensure enough samples to capture class variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Handle missing values** (impute or drop).\n",
    "* **Encode categorical variables** (One-Hot, Label Encoding).\n",
    "* **Feature scaling** (Standardization or Min-Max normalization is very important for SVC, since margin depends on distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Train-Test Split**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split dataset into **training** and **testing/validation** sets.\n",
    "* Optionally use **Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation** (to preserve class proportions).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Choose SVC Type**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hard Margin SVC** â†’ if data is perfectly separable.\n",
    "* **Soft Margin SVC** â†’ more realistic; allows misclassification (controlled by **C parameter**).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Select Kernel**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linear Kernel** â†’ if data is linearly separable.\n",
    "* **Polynomial Kernel** â†’ for polynomial-like decision boundaries.\n",
    "* **RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel** â†’ for flexible nonlinear boundaries.\n",
    "* **Sigmoid Kernel** â†’ less common, for specific problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Model Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fit the SVC model on training data.\n",
    "* Optimization: maximize the **margin** while minimizing misclassification penalty.\n",
    "* Only **support vectors** determine the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tune important parameters (usually with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **C** â†’ controls margin width vs misclassification.\n",
    "  * **Î³ (gamma)** â†’ controls influence of a single training point (RBF/poly kernels).\n",
    "  * **degree** â†’ for polynomial kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. Model Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use classification performance metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "* **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**\n",
    "* **ROC Curve and AUC**\n",
    "* For imbalanced datasets â†’ focus on Precision-Recall trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. Model Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **cross-validation** to ensure generalization.\n",
    "* Check for **overfitting** (small margin, high C) vs **underfitting** (too wide margin, small C).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **11. Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save trained model (`joblib` / `pickle`).\n",
    "* Integrate into production pipeline (e.g., FastAPI, Flask, MLflow, ZenML, etc.).\n",
    "* Monitor performance over time (concept drift, new data distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
