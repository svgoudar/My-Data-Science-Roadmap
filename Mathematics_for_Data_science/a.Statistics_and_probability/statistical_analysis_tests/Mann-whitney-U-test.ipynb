    "\n",
    "* A **non-parametric test** used to compare **two independent samples** to assess whether they come from the same distribution.\n",
    "* Unlike the t-test, it **does not assume normality**, so it's great for **non-normal or ordinal data**.\n",

    "## 📝 **When to use it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When data is **ordinal** or not normally distributed.\n",
    "* When comparing **medians** between **two independent groups**.\n",
    "* It is an alternative to the **independent samples t-test** when normality is questionable.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Combines the data from both groups, ranks them, and then evaluates how the ranks are distributed between the groups.\n",
    "* The test statistic is based on the **sum of ranks**.\n",

    "## 🧮 **Hypotheses**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Null hypothesis (H0):** Both groups have the same distribution (no difference).\n",
