    "### Variable Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "We have four different types of measured variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nominal**\n",
    "2. **Ordinal**\n",
    "3. **Interval**\n",
    "4. **Ratio**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these types is crucial because your dataset will contain these variables, enabling you to perform effective data analysis. Let’s explore each type:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nominal\n",
    "\n",
    "Nominal data, also known as categorical or qualitative data, is divided into different classes. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Colors\n",
    "* Gender\n",
    "* Types of flowers\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of data is used to label variables without providing any quantitative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "In ordinal data, the order of values matters, but the specific value does not. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Students' marks: 100, 96, 57, 85, 44\n",
    "  * Ranks: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the focus is on the order (ranks) rather than the actual values (marks).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval data has meaningful order and values, but lacks a true zero. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Temperature in Fahrenheit: 70-80°F, 80-90°F\n",
    "* Distance ranges: 10-20 miles, 20-30 miles\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero Fahrenheit does not signify the absence of temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio data has all the properties of interval data, but with a meaningful zero point, indicating the absence of the variable being measured. This means you can make meaningful statements about how many times greater one object is compared to another. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Height:** Zero height means the absence of height.\n",
    "* **Weight:** Zero weight means the absence of weight.\n",
    "* **Income:** Zero income means no income.\n",
    "* **Distance:** Zero distance means no distance traveled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Height\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:** 150 cm, 160 cm, 170 cm, 180 cm, 190 cm\n",
    "* **Properties:**\n",
    "  * Order matters: 150 cm < 160 cm < 170 cm < 180 cm < 190 cm\n",
    "  * Value matters: The difference between 150 cm and 160 cm is the same as between 180 cm and 190 cm.\n",
    "  * True zero: A height of 0 cm indicates no height.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weight\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:** 50 kg, 60 kg, 70 kg, 80 kg, 90 kg\n",
    "* **Properties:**\n",
    "  * Order matters: 50 kg < 60 kg < 70 kg < 80 kg < 90 kg\n",
    "  * Value matters: The difference between 50 kg and 60 kg is the same as between 80 kg and 90 kg.\n",
    "  * True zero: A weight of 0 kg indicates no weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Income\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:** $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000\n",
    "* **Properties:**\n",
    "  * Order matters: $30,000 < $40,000 < $50,000 < $60,000 < $70,000\n",
    "  * Value matters: The difference between $30,000 and $40,000 is the same as between $60,000 and $70,000.\n",
    "  * True zero: An income of $0 indicates no income.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data:** 10 km, 20 km, 30 km, 40 km, 50 km\n",
    "* **Properties:**\n",
    "  * Order matters: 10 km < 20 km < 30 km < 40 km < 50 km\n",
    "  * Value matters: The difference between 10 km and 20 km is the same as between 40 km and 50 km.\n",
    "  * True zero: A distance of 0 km indicates no distance traveled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Order Matters:** Like ordinal and interval data, the order of values in ratio data is meaningful.\n",
    "* **Value Matters:** The difference between values is consistent and meaningful.\n",
    "* **True Zero:** Unlike interval data, ratio data has a true zero, making statements like \"twice as much\" meaningful.\n",

    "2. **Random Assignment**:\n",

    "\n",
    "When making an estimate, we should consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Closeness to the Parameter** – The estimate should aim to be as close as possible to the actual population value.\n",
    "2. **Bias** – Any consistent error in the estimate caused by the sampling method or other flaws should be avoided.\n",
    "3. **Chance Error** – Some variability is always present due to random sampling; we must account for this natural uncertainty.\n",
